# My Commitment

I, D3rrick La, commit to building FortuneLink MVP in 8 weeks.

I will:
- Follow the weekly plan without scope creep
- Ship working code every week
- Not refactor working features
- Add ideas to LATER.md instead of implementing them
- Deploy by end of Week 8

If I find myself redesigning the domain model again, I will:
- Close my IDE
- Re-read this document
- Get back to building features

Target completion date: [date 8 weeks from now]

You're on the right track, but let me help clarify the standard approach for totalTransactionAmount in financial systems to ensure accuracy and consistency:
For Asset Purchases (Stocks, Bonds, etc.)
Standard approach: Include the gross amount (price × quantity) plus all fees and commissions
Why: This represents the total cash outflow from your account. Most financial systems track the "total cost basis" which includes all costs associated with acquiring the asset.
Example:

Buy 100 shares at $50 = $5,000
Commission fee = $10
totalTransactionAmount = $5,010

For Liabilities (Loans, Credit, etc.)
Standard approach: The gross loan amount before any origination fees are deducted
Why: This represents the actual liability you've taken on, regardless of fees.
Example:

Loan amount = $10,000
Origination fee = $200 (deducted from disbursement)
Cash received = $9,800
totalTransactionAmount = $10,000 (the liability amount)
Fee would be tracked separately

Additional Considerations
Dividends/Interest: Face value received
Sales: Gross proceeds before fees (fees tracked separately or net amount calculated elsewhere)
Transfers: The amount transferred (no fees typically)
This approach aligns with how major platforms like Schwab, Fidelity, and accounting systems handle transaction amounts. The key principle is that totalTransactionAmount represents the primary financial impact of the transaction, with fees either included (for purchases) or tracked separately (for other transaction types).
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific transaction types for your system?


Looking at your Transaction class, I can see the design is well-structured to handle the scenarios we discussed. Let me clarify how totalTransactionAmount should work with this design:
Key Insight: Net Cash Impact
Your comment "Net cash impact of the transaction" is the key principle. This means totalTransactionAmount represents the actual change to your portfolio's cash position in the portfolio's base currency.
How This Works for Different Transaction Types:
Stock Purchase:

totalTransactionAmount = -(price × quantity + fees) // negative because cash decreases
fees = individual fee breakdown in original currency
transactionDetails = stock info, original currency amounts, exchange rates

Loan (Liability):

totalTransactionAmount = +amount received after fees // positive because cash increases
fees = origination fees, processing fees
transactionDetails = loan terms, original currency

Stock Sale:

totalTransactionAmount = +(gross proceeds - fees) // positive because cash increases
fees = commission, regulatory fees
transactionDetails = stock info, sale details

Dividend:

totalTransactionAmount = +dividend amount (after any withholding)
fees = withholding taxes (if modeled as fees)
transactionDetails = dividend details, tax info

Benefits of This Approach:

Cash Flow Clarity: Sum all totalTransactionAmount values = net cash change
Fee Transparency: Detailed fee breakdown preserved in fees list
Currency Handling: Portfolio currency standardization while preserving original details
Audit Trail: Original transaction details maintained for compliance

This design aligns with professional portfolio management systems where the primary concern is tracking actual cash impact on the portfolio while maintaining full transaction detail fidelity.
Does this interpretation match your intended design?RetryJso things like stock buying, transactionAmoutn will be price * quantity + fees while loans would be loanAmount - feesEditNot quite - you're mixing the gross transaction value with the net cash impact concept. Let me clarify:
Your totalTransactionAmount = "Net cash impact" (per your comment)
Stock Purchase:

totalTransactionAmount = -(price × quantity + fees)
Negative because cash leaves your portfolio
Example: Buy $5,000 stock + $10 fee = -$5,010

Loan (taking out a loan):

totalTransactionAmount = +(loan amount - fees)
Positive because cash enters your portfolio
Example: $10,000 loan - $200 origination fee = +$9,800

The Key Principle:

Positive totalTransactionAmount = cash increases in portfolio
Negative totalTransactionAmount = cash decreases in portfolio

Why This Works:

Stock purchase: You spend cash → negative impact
Loan disbursement: You receive cash → positive impact
Stock sale: You receive cash → positive impact
Loan payment: You spend cash → negative impact

The sign convention ensures that summing all totalTransactionAmount values gives you the net change in portfolio cash, which is exactly what "net cash impact" means.
Your fees list still captures the detailed fee breakdown in original currency for audit/reporting purposes.
Does this cash flow perspective make sense for your design?
